# miniGPT
Mini GPT implementation, following Andrej Karpathy's tutorial

A lightweight implementation of a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model from scratch using PyTorch. This project includes training and text generation capabilities.

## Usage

Train the model:
```bash
python train.py
```

Generate text:
```bash
python generate.py
```

## Project Structure

- `model.py` - GPT model architecture
- `train.py` - Training script
- `generate.py` - Text generation script
- `data.py` - Data loading and preprocessing
- `config.py` - Model and training configuration
